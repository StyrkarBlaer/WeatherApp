# Typescript Weather and time webapp

Run with Npm start


So far this has tunred out to be more of an exercise in html/css than typescript.
I've abandoned this project in favour of working more with React and its frameworks in stead of just raw typescript.
I'll probably come back and finish this project sometime in the future just because.
